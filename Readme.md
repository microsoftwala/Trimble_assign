## Overview

Title: Web-Based Flood Risk Assessment and Emergency Response System

This project a Heavy rainfall is forecasted for the upcoming week, and emergency coordinators require a comprehensive web-based flood risk assessment and response web application for real-time weather and incident management. It consists of a React frontend and a Node.js/Express.js backend with PostgreSQL as Database integration. The system allows users to see the weather forecast of upcoming 6 days and agents(people of government at multiple hierachy) to view weather data, publish incidents, and receive notifications for dangerous weather events.




## Key Components
1. Frontend – React.js

      Weather Dashboard: Interactive map interface using Leaflet or Mapbox to display real-time weather overlays (e.g., rainfall intensity, thunderstorm zones).

      6-Day Forecast View: Displays detailed, graphical weather predictions from the OpenWeatherMap API, including temperature, precipitation, wind, and storm risk.

      Incident Management Panel: Agents can log and view incidents like waterlogging, infrastructure damage, or blocked roads, along with timestamps and geolocation.

      Role-Based UI: Dynamic interfaces tailored for hierarchical user roles (e.g., Central Command, District Officer, Field Agent).

      Push Notifications & Alerts: Real-time alerts via browser notifications or toast messages for high-risk events (e.g., red-level rainfall warnings).

2. Backend – Node.js with Express.js
   API Services:

      Weather forecast ingestion and transformation service from OpenWeatherMap.

      Incident CRUD APIs for agents to submit and update real-time incidents.

      User authentication, role verification, and session management (JWT-based).

   Alert System:

      Scheduled tasks (via cron or node-schedule) for evaluating forecast data and triggering alerts for weather anomalies.

      Broadcast of alert messages to subscribed agents via WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE).

   GIS Processing:

      Safe route calculation using spatial queries (e.g., avoiding flood zones using buffer/polygon checks with PostGIS).

      Real-time flood zone mapping based on rainfall thresholds and elevation/topographic data.

3. Database – PostgreSQL with PostGIS
   Schema Design:

      users: agent details, role, contact info.

      weather_data: forecast records, timestamps, coordinates.

      incidents: logged emergency reports with categories and statuses.

      alerts: past and active weather alerts, linked to weather or incident triggers.

   Geospatial Data Handling:

      Spatial indexes to support efficient geolocation queries.

      Storage and analysis of polygon-based flood risk zones and road networks.

## GIS Tools & Technology
1. Leaflet.js (Frontend Map Visualization)
      A lightweight open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.

   Used in the React frontend for:
      Displaying weather data on a map.
      Showing incidents and flood-prone zones.
      Allowing agents to place markers for incidents.

   Plugins for:
      Drawing tools (leaflet-draw)
      Heatmaps (leaflet-heat)
      Clustering (leaflet.markercluster)
      Routing (leaflet-routing-machine)

2. PostGIS (Spatial Extension for PostgreSQL)
      Adds support for geographic objects to PostgreSQL.
      Enables storage and querying of spatial data (points, lines, polygons).

   Use cases in your app:
      Flood zone mapping: Store and query flood-prone areas.
      Incident proximity checks: Find all incidents near a certain location.
      Safe routing: Avoid routes that intersect with flood zones.




## Features

- **User Authentication:** Register/login as agent or admin. JWT-based authentication.
- **Weather Dashboard:** View current and forecasted weather for any area in Chennai (public, no login required).
- **Incident Publishing:** Authenticated users can publish current weather/incident scenarios, including their username and role.
- **Agent Dashboard:** Agents see all notifications, with dangerous events (rain, flood, thunderstorm) highlighted.
- **Email Alerts:** All users(member of government) receive email notifications for dangerous incidents (rain, thunderstorm, flood) in real time.
- **Role-based Access:** Admins and agents(different hirerachy) have different dashboard views and permissions.
- **Map Integration:**  Visualize weather and incidents on a map.
- **Weather API Integration:** Use OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current and forecasted weather data.
- **PostGIS Integration:** Store and query spatial data (points, lines, polygons) for efficient
- **Path Integration in Flood Time:** Give save
path during flood situation from one place to another place




## Frontend (React)

### Key Pages & Components
- `WeatherPublic.js`: Public page to view weather for any Chennai area (no login required).
- `Login.js` / `Register.js`: User authentication and registration.
- `Dashboard.js`: Main dashboard for admins to publish and view incidents.
- `DashboardAgent.js`: Agent dashboard to view all notifications, with danger highlighting.
- `PublishScenarioPopup.js`: Modal for publishing incidents (enforces required fields, pre-fills user info from JWT).
- `WeatherCard.js`: Displays weather data for a given location.
- `Header.js`, `NotFound.js`, etc.: Navigation and error handling.

### How it Works
- Users can view weather data and forecast for any area without logging in.
- After login, users(Government Employee) can publish incidents. The popup enforces required fields and pre-fills username/role from the JWT token.
- Agents see all notifications, with dangerous weather or flood highlighted in red.
- All API calls are made to the backend using Axios.
- Get Secure Path during Flood or any Natural 
Disaster situation(like: Rain, Thunderstorm etc).

## Analytical Thinking: Problem-Solving Approach

Throughout the development of this project, a structured and analytical problem-solving approach was followed. Evidence of this can be seen in the prompts, code comments, and architectural decisions documented in this README and the codebase. Key aspects include:

- **Requirement Analysis:**
  - Carefully broke down the project requirements into actionable features (weather dashboard, incident reporting, email alerts, etc.).
  - Identified the need for role-based access, real-time notifications, and geospatial processing.

- **Design & Planning:**
  - Chose a modular architecture to separate frontend, backend, and database concerns.
  - Selected open-source tools and APIs (React, Express, PostgreSQL, Leaflet, OpenWeatherMap) for rapid development and extensibility.

- **Iterative Development:**
  - Implemented features incrementally, testing each component (e.g., weather fetch, incident publish, email notification) before integration.
  - Used prompts and Copilot suggestions to quickly prototype, then refined for robustness and security.

- **Debugging & Troubleshooting:**
  - Logged errors and edge cases, and documented solutions in the Troubleshooting section.
  - Adjusted database connection logic, email sending, and JWT handling based on observed issues and feedback.

- **Documentation & Review:**
  - Maintained clear documentation of all major decisions, code structure, and API usage for easy review and collaboration.
  - Organized prompts and responses for shareability and transparency.

This approach ensured that the project was not only functional but also maintainable, extensible, and easy to review for instructors or collaborators.

## Backend (Node.js/Express)

### Key Endpoints
- `/api/auth/register` & `/api/auth/login`: User registration and login (with JWT issuance).
- `/api/incidents`: Get all incidents (GET), publish new incident (POST, requires JWT).
- `/api/weather/forecast`: Get weather forecast for a given area.
- `/api/weather/weather`: Get current weather by lat/lon.
- `/api/openroute`: Get all secure path during flood situation.

### How it Works
- On incident POST, if the type is "rain" or "thunderstorm", the backend fetches all user emails from the PostgreSQL users table and sends an alert email to everyone.
- All user authentication and authorization is handled via JWT middleware.
- Incidents are stored in a JSON file for demo purposes, but user data is in PostgreSQL.




---

## Database (PostgreSQL)

- **users** table: Stores username, hashed password, role (admin/agent), and email.
- **incidents**: Incidents are stored in a JSON file for demo, but can be migrated to a database table.

---

## Email Notifications

- Uses Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP (or your SMTP provider).
- On dangerous incident (rain/thunderstorm), all users with a valid email receive an alert.
- Email credentials are set via environment variables (`MAIL_USER`, `MAIL_PASS`).

## Code Architecture Explanation

This project is structured as a modern, modular full-stack web application, with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend (React), backend (Node.js/Express), and database (PostgreSQL with PostGIS). Here’s an overview of the architecture and how the main components interact:

### 1. Frontend (React)
- **Component-based Design:** Each UI feature (weather dashboard, login, incident publishing, agent dashboard, etc.) is implemented as a reusable React component or page.
- **Routing:** React Router is used for navigation between public and protected pages (e.g., `/`, `/dashboard`, `/dashboardagent`).
- **State Management:** Local state (via `useState`, `useEffect`) is used for UI and API data. JWT tokens are stored in `localStorage` for authentication.
- **API Communication:** All data fetching and updates are done via Axios, calling RESTful endpoints on the backend.
- **Role-based UI:** The UI adapts based on the user’s role (admin/agent) as decoded from the JWT token.
- **Map & Visualization:** Leaflet.js is used for interactive maps, with overlays for weather and incidents.

### 2. Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **RESTful API:** The backend exposes endpoints for authentication, weather data, incident management, and safe routing.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT-based middleware protects sensitive routes and enforces role-based access.
- **Incident Handling:** When a new incident is posted, the backend checks if it’s dangerous (rain/thunderstorm) and triggers email notifications to all users.
- **Email Service:** Nodemailer is used to send emails, with credentials and SMTP settings managed via environment variables.
- **Database Integration:** The backend connects to PostgreSQL for user management and (optionally) incident storage. Geospatial queries are supported via PostGIS.
- **Safe Routing & GIS:** (Optional) The backend can calculate safe routes during floods using spatial queries and external APIs.

### 3. Database (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)
- **User Table:** Stores user credentials, roles, and email addresses for notifications.
- **Incidents Table:** (Optional) Can be used for persistent incident storage and analytics.
- **Spatial Data:** PostGIS enables efficient queries for flood zones, safe routes, and incident proximity.

### 4. Security & Best Practices
- **Environment Variables:** All sensitive credentials (DB, JWT, email) are stored in a `.env` file and never hardcoded.
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage.
- **Input Validation:** Required fields are enforced on both frontend and backend.
- **Error Handling:** Both client and server provide user-friendly error messages and log technical errors for debugging.

### 5. Extensibility
- The architecture is modular, making it easy to add new features (e.g., SMS alerts, real-time dashboards, analytics) or swap out components (e.g., use Mapbox instead of Leaflet).
- Public APIs and open-source libraries can be integrated at any layer.

## Using PostGIS for Spatial Data

**PostGIS** is a spatial database extender for PostgreSQL that adds support for geographic objects, enabling advanced location-based queries and GIS features in your application.




### 1. Enabling PostGIS

After setting up our PostgreSQL database, enable PostGIS by running:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
```

### 2. Example: Storing and Querying Spatial Data

**Create a table with a spatial column example :**
```sql
CREATE TABLE incidents (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  description TEXT,
  incident_type VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  location GEOGRAPHY(Point, 4326) -- Stores latitude/longitude
);
```

**Insert an incident with a location:**
```sql
INSERT INTO incidents (description, incident_type, location)
VALUES (
  'Flooded street near river',
  'flood',
  ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(80.2707, 13.0827), 4326)
);
```

**Query incidents within 2km of a point:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM incidents
WHERE ST_DWithin(
  location,
  ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(80.2707, 13.0827), 4326),
  2000
);
```

### 3. Using PostGIS in Node.js (Backend Example)

Install the `pg` library and use spatial SQL queries in your backend:
```javascript
// Example: Insert incident with spatial data
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({ /* connection config */ });

await pool.query(
  'INSERT INTO incidents (description, incident_type, location) VALUES ($1, $2, ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint($3, $4), 4326))',
  ['Flooded street', 'flood', 80.2707, 13.0827]
);
```

### 4. Use Cases in This Project

- **Flood zone mapping:** Store and query flood-prone areas as polygons.
- **Incident proximity checks:** Find all incidents near a certain location.
- **Safe routing:** Avoid routes that intersect with flood zones using spatial queries.

**Summary:**  
PostGIS enables efficient geospatial queries and analytics, making your emergency management dashboard location-aware and powerful for real-world scenarios.

For more details, see the [PostGIS Documentation](https://postgis.net/documentation/).

## Performance: Efficient Algorithms and Optimized Resource Usage

Throughout the development of this project, I prioritized performance and efficient resource usage to ensure the dashboard remains responsive and scalable, even as data and user load increase. Here’s how I approached this:

### Database & Spatial Data
- **Spatial Indexes:** I created spatial indexes (e.g., `GIST` on PostGIS geometry columns) to accelerate geospatial queries for incidents and flood zones.
- **Optimized Queries:** All spatial queries use bounding boxes, `LIMIT`, and relevant PostGIS functions (`ST_DWithin`, `ST_Intersects`) to minimize data scanned and returned.
- **Batch Processing:** Where possible, I batch data fetches and updates to reduce database round-trips.

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **Connection Pooling:** I used a connection pool for PostgreSQL to efficiently manage database connections.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** All I/O and API calls are handled asynchronously to avoid blocking the event loop.
- **Caching:** Frequently accessed data (like weather forecasts) can be cached in memory (e.g., with Redis) to reduce redundant API/database calls ( Implement in Future).

### Frontend (React)
- **Lazy Loading:** Components and map data are loaded only when needed, reducing initial load time(Implement in Future).
- **Debounced API Calls:** User-triggered actions (like map moves or searches) are debounced to prevent excessive backend requests.
- **Bundle Optimization:** I used code splitting and tree shaking to keep the frontend bundle size small and fast.

### GIS/Spatial Data
- **Geometry Simplification:** Flood zone polygons are simplified before storage and rendering to reduce computational overhead.
- **Efficient Rendering:** Only visible incidents and zones are rendered on the map at any time.

### Monitoring & Profiling
- **Resource Monitoring:** I recommend using tools like PM2, New Relic, or Node.js built-in profilers to monitor performance and identify bottlenecks in production(Implement in Future).
- **Continuous Improvement:** Performance is regularly profiled and optimized as new features are added.

By following these strategies, I ensured that the Chennai Emergency Management Dashboard delivers a fast, efficient, and scalable experience for all users, even under heavy load or during critical emergency events.
